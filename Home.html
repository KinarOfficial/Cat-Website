            <h3> <a name="background"> My Background</a></h3>
              <p>I have moved around the majority of my life being an army brat and finally settled in North Carolina. I attended Crest Middle school then went on to Cleveland Early College High School or CECHS where I graduate from high school and CCC at the same time. After graduating from CCC I went on to UNCC pursuing a B.S. in Game Development and Design and Artificial Intelligence. After completing the majority of the program I left UNCC and attended again CCC pursuing their Web Dev
              and Design degree as well as Networking and Cybersecurity degrees. However, jumping to more personal levels, I typically find myself playing and streaming games. I adore building and maintaining PCs, setting up devices especially Smart
              devices, and generally making PC setups look appealing through dusting and cable management.
                <p>
                  <h3> <a name ="future">My Future</a></h3>
                      <p> Currently my future plans are to graduate from CCC and look towards getting a job in Charlotte so that I can afford to live there and start a  career. Potentially, going to UNCC part time and continuing my education    while working.
                      Ideally I would love to be able to finish a B.S. at UNCC and find a career in Game Dev/Design as a level or concept designer. I have worked in AI some and do not enjoy all the tedious work that goes into making convincing AI. Overall,
                      I am just eager to get into the industry in any capacity as Game Design/Level Design has been a passion of mine since I first played Halo C.E. way back when.
